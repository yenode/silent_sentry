    # Environment-specific tuning
    # For indoor environments:
    # - Lower max_correspondence_distance (0.2)
    # - Higher feature requirements (15)
    # - More aggressive downsampling (3)
    
    # For outdoor environments:
    # - Higher max_correspondence_distance (0.5)
    # - Lower feature requirements (5)
    # - Less downsampling (1-2)
    
    # For mixed environments:
    # - Adaptive thresholds based on feature density
    # - Dynamic correspondence distance
    # - Quality-based parameter adjustment
