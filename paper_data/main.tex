% --- ABSTRACT ---
\begin{abstract}
Persistent border surveillance in unstructured, semi-arid environments presents critical challenges for autonomous systems. Traditional static sensor networks suffer from terrain occlusion, while multi-agent robotics rely heavily on continuous Radio Frequency (RF) state-sharing, creating severe vulnerabilities in Electronic Warfare (EW) contested environments. This paper proposes a decentralized, partition-based architecture for Ackermann-steered Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) operating under strict Emission Control (EMCON). We introduce four key novelties: (1) a Spatially-Bounded Lévy Patrol (SBLP) algorithm that guarantees mathematically unpredictable, geo-fenced sector coverage with zero inter-agent communication; (2) a Dynamic Semantic Costmap Injection pipeline utilizing zero-shot Edge Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to resolve geometric LiDAR false-positives; (3) a perception-agnostic, event-driven Zenoh middleware topology that bypasses standard DDS discovery storms; and (4) an offline-trained Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy for Elastic Geo-Fencing, enabling macroscopic fleet cohesion and self-healing coverage without edge-to-edge network negotiation. Validated via OS-level network emulation and high-fidelity Isaac Sim environments, the system demonstrates robust, radio-silent navigation using LIO-SAM under simulated GPS denial.

% --- SECTION I: INTRODUCTION ---
\section{Introduction}
Current border security relies heavily on physical fencing and static camera towers, which suffer from line-of-sight occlusion in rolling dune terrains. While Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) provide rapid response, they lack endurance and are highly susceptible to catastrophic drift during GNSS denial events. 

While Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) offer the required persistence, current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) multi-agent frameworks fail in contested domains due to two critical dependencies: the continuous RF emission of standard ROS 2 DDS networks (which enables adversary triangulation), and the geometric limitations of local planners (which trap UGVs via LiDAR false-positives). We propose the "Silent Sentry" architecture, transitioning from cooperative swarms to an Independent Sentinel Network. By synthesizing biological foraging mathematics, foundation AI models, connectionless middleware, and deep reinforcement learning, we present a system capable of unpredictable, fully autonomous operations with a zero-idle RF footprint.

% --- SECTION II: RELATED WORKS & NOVELTY ---
\section{Related Works \& Statement of Novelty}

\subsection{Multi-Agent Coverage and Zero-Communication Constraints}
Standard multi-robot area coverage algorithms require continuous state-sharing via mesh networks, making them vulnerable to EW jamming. While biological Lévy flights ($P(l) \sim l^{-\beta}$) have been adapted for swarm robotics, they are predominantly applied to holonomic agents in unconstrained spaces. We introduce the SBLP algorithm, which guarantees unpredictable sector coverage by integrating Ackermann kinematic smoothing and geo-fenced rejection sampling, eliminating the need for digital coordination.

\subsection{Semantic Traversability via Vision-Language Models}
Purely geometric planners frequently suffer from "false positive" lethal obstacles, such as crushable vegetation. Recent literature explores VLMs for zero-shot traversability, though continuous inference remains computationally prohibitive on edge devices. We propose Dynamic Semantic Costmap Injection, utilizing a quantized Edge-VLM purely as an asynchronous, on-demand heuristic to dynamically rewrite voxel costs.

\subsection{Stealth Network Topologies in ROS 2}
The DDS standard assumes reliable, high-bandwidth networks, utilizing continuous UDP multicast. We weaponize the Eclipse Zenoh protocol as a deliberate EMCON tool. By physically tying RF transmission states to a standardized perception trigger, we present a resilient, hardware-coupled network topology designed explicitly for radio-silent operations.

\subsection{Macroscopic Cohesion via RL}
To resolve the geographic vulnerability created when an agent abandons its sector, traditional swarms use mesh-network consensus algorithms. We introduce an offline-trained RL policy at the centralized Base Station to evaluate topographic costmaps and broadcast mathematically optimized reallocation coordinates, enabling self-healing coverage without edge-to-edge communication.

% --- SECTION III: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ---
\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Digital Twin \& Hardware Specifications}
To ensure Sim-to-Real viability, the digital twin mirrors a physical Ackermann-steered chassis optimized for edge-compute constraints:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Compute:} NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super.
    \item \textbf{Perception Stack:} Robosense RS-Helios-32 (32-channel LiDAR) coupled with a BMI088 6-axis IMU and an Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) payload.
    \item \textbf{Kinematics:} Ackermann steering constraints to accurately model minimum turning radii ($r_{min}$) on high-slip surfaces.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Stack}
The framework is built on \textbf{ROS 2 Humble}. Localization is handled by LIO-SAM to ensure robust map generation without GNSS dependencies. Global Planning is managed by the Nav2 Smac Hybrid-A* planner, strictly constrained by UGV kinematic limits.

% --- SECTION IV: METHODOLOGY ---
\section{Methodology: Independent Sentinel Logic}

\subsection{Spatially-Bounded Lévy Patrol (SBLP)}
To ensure unpredictable spatial coverage without inter-agent coordination, deterministic waypoints are replaced with a heavy-tailed probability distribution. The step length $l$ is drawn from a Lévy distribution $P(l) \sim l^{-\beta}$, where $1 < \beta \le 3$. To respect UGV kinematics, the algorithm utilizes a rejection sampler that mathematically guarantees the agent remains within a predefined GPS polygon.

\subsection{Dynamic Semantic Costmap Injection}
To resolve LiDAR false-positives, we integrate a quantized VLM (LLaVA-v1.5-7b-int4) into the low-level control loop. If the local planner detects a geometric blockage, the UGV halts and queries the VLM to classify the obstacle's physical affordance. The VLM output applies a scalar weight $\omega \in [0, 1]$ to dynamically rewrite the Nav2 voxel cost, allowing the UGV to crush soft vegetation.

\subsection{Perception-Agnostic EMCON via Asynchronous Zenoh}
Relying strictly on RGB networks introduces vulnerabilities against camouflaged adversaries. The architecture abstracts the detection phase into a modular, standardized boolean trigger. Upon anomaly detection, a hardware-coupled state machine activates the transceiver from a Receive-Only (RX) bias. The UGV executes a connectionless UDP micro-burst via the native Eclipse Zenoh API to a centralized Base Station, bypassing DDS discovery storms entirely, before returning to RX-only.

\subsection{Macroscopic Cohesion via RL-Optimized Elastic Geo-Fencing}
Formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), the Base Station's RL agent evaluates the topographic costmap and breach coordinates. The reward function is defined as:
$$R = (W_1 \cdot C_{coverage}) - (W_2 \cdot E_{travel}) - (W_3 \cdot T_{terrain})$$
By broadcasting a single, encrypted Zenoh UDP packet to the remaining fleet, the agents autonomously stretch their SBLP parameters over the optimal terrain, allowing the disconnected fleet to react as a unified macroscopic organism.

% --- SECTION V: EXPERIMENTAL SETUP ---
\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{OS-Level Network Emulation}
To empirically validate the EMCON capabilities without relying on physical MANET radios, a Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) approach was utilized. The UGV logic was isolated within Docker containers, partitioned by unique \texttt{ROS\_DOMAIN\_ID}s. The Linux kernel's \texttt{iptables} were dynamically manipulated to emulate the physical severing of the RF datalink.

\subsection{The Physics Environment}
Validation was conducted in \textbf{NVIDIA Isaac Sim}, utilizing a custom physics material profile (Static Friction = 0.4, Restitution = 0.0) mapped over digital elevation models to accurately simulate wheel-slip dynamics in desert topologies. Unidirectional sensor telemetry was piped from the simulation domain to the isolated Docker containers via the \texttt{domain\_bridge} package.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
By decoupling tactical communications from underlying DDS middleware, utilizing VLMs for local costmap resolution, and employing RL for centralized fleet reallocation, the Silent Sentry architecture successfully demonstrates that distributed, partition-based multi-agent systems can maintain highly effective, self-healing border coverage under strict zero-communication constraints. 

Future work will focus on transitioning this architecture from SITL network emulation to physical Jetson Orin Nano platforms equipped with analog MANET radios, alongside field-testing the VLM inference in dynamic weather conditions such as sandstorms.
